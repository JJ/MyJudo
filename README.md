MyJudo

This is an experiemntal website using Rakudo (Rakudobrew) Perl6 and Bailador.

You can start the site locally with: 
```
bailador watch bin/app.pl6
```

You can run tests with:
```
 prove -lv --exec perl6 t
```

I am currently exploring using git-ssb to host the development of this
so bear with me. :-)
The ssb link for this repo is:

This should in theory be private to me.
